# Belimo Cloud simulation

Python package to simulate cloud connected devices

## Energy Valve

Emulates an EnergyValve connected to a Heat Exhanger (currently modelled as NTU + some pipe delay). Provides the basic heat exchanger characteristics and can be tuned to show different behaviours.

First implementation only supports sending data to the Device API, not receiving setting changes etc.

16. **`Cooling_E_J`**: Total energy consumed for cooling in joules.

### **Glycol Concentration and Control**
17. **`Glycol_Concentration_Rel`**: Relative glycol concentration in the system (used for frost protection and efficiency calculation).
18. **`ControlMode_Write`**: Indicates the control mode set on the device (e.g., automatic, manual).
19. **`DeltaT_Limitation_Write`**: Setting for limiting the temperature differential (`Î”T`) across the valve.
20. **`SpDeltaT_K_Write`**: Setpoint for the desired temperature differential (`Î”T`) in Kelvin.
21. **`Pmax_Rel_Write`**: Maximum power setting as a percentage of nominal power.
22. **`Vmax_Rel_Write`**: Maximum flow setting as a percentage of nominal flow.
23. **`InstallationPosition_Write`**: Defines the physical installation position of the valve (e.g., horizontal or vertical).
24. **`Override_Write`**: Indicates if the valve is being manually overridden.

### **Valve and System Characteristics**

37. **`Y3AnalogInputValue`**: Analog input value from an external sensor or third-party device (nullable).

This dataset likely originates from Belimoâ€™s **Energy Valve** or similar HVAC control devices, monitoring heating/cooling efficiency, power consumption, and valve control parameters. Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸš€
